  <p>
    hey,<br><br>

    i made this little website for you because i just wanted to do something special before valentine comes<br>
    and i just want to say i love you so much like really a lot<br><br>

    i know sometimes i have acted immature and said things i shouldn’t have<br>
    but that never means i don’t care about you<br>
    i care about you more than you know and you mean so much to me<br><br>

    You make me feel calm happy and understood<br> 
    just having you in my life feels like the best thing<br><br>

    i’m sorry for the times i made things hard between us<br>
    but i promise i will make things better and i will always try my best for us<br>
    i want to be with you till the end no matter what<br><br>

    the next few months are gonna be hectic i know<br>
    we both have studies and exams and we need to focus on that right now<br>
    and maybe next month i won’t get that much time to make all this for you<br>
    that’s why i did it early hehe<br><br>

    I choose you today and ill choose you every  single time<br><br>

    and don’t worry about the thing i wanted to give you<br>
    the one you said give it when the time is right<br>
    i’ll wait for it and keep it safe always<br>
    i won’t forget<br><br>

    <br><br>

    always yours ❤️
